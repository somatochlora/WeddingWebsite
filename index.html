            <h3>Things to Know</h3>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">You won't actually see us get married!</p>
                <p>Emily has always dreamed of getting married at city hall - so we are officially tying the knot at London City Hall in advance. But Reuven wants a big gathering, so we've planned our celebration to be the best of both worlds. We think you'll enjoy it!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Want to give a speech?</p>
                <p>We invite you to give a speech, tell a story, or otherwise make a <em>short</em>, 2 minute, presentation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Kids are absolutely welcome!</p>
                <p>We'll have lots of kid-friendly food and activities, and lots of room to run and play and nap in the shade.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Come in your most comfortable garden party chic.</p>
                <p>We'll be wearing our best garden party looks - florals, linen, big hats and fascinators welcome! Please wear what you'll find comfortable. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Come hungry!</p>
                <p>We're planning a great spread of all our garden party favourites and there will be something for everyone. We will also be serving coffee, tea, soft drinks and water. Let us know in the survey if you have any dietary restrictions we should keep in mind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Ready for a party?</p>
                <p>Us too! We can't serve alcohol in the park, so we're hosting a bowling afterparty on Saturday Sept. 23 7:30-11:30 pm. There will be light supper served and a cash bar, with bowling lanes for all. This will be accessible and suitable for all ages. Let us know in the survey if you're interested in attending.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Things to know about the park:</p>
                <p>There are picnic tables, but feel free to bring a lawn chair or picnic blanket if you want to spread out.</p>
                <p>Don't forget your binoculars if you have them.</p>
                <p>There are washrooms in the park, but they are about a 100 m walk from the picnic shelter.</p>
                <p>Ample parking is available, limited accessible parking - let us know if you need a close spot.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Please take lots of photos!</p>
                <p>We're not hiring a photographer, so we'd love if you can take lots of photos and share on Instagram with the hashtag #ReuvAndEm</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">In case of rain:</p>
                <p>The picnic shelter is large and covered - we will be there unless the rain is blowing sideways! We will contact you with the info you provide in the RSVP survey.</p>
