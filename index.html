            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Head's up - you won't actually see us get married!</p>
                <p>Emily has always dreamed of getting married at city hall - so we are officially tying the knot at London City Hall in advance. But we also really want to share this special moment with you and the rest of our loved ones!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Kids are absolutely welcome!</p>
                <p>We'll have lots of kid-friendly food and activities, and lots of room to run and play and nap in the shade.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">An invite to wear your best linen, seersucker or florals!</p>
                <p>TThere is no dress code - please wear what you'll find comfortable! We'll be wearing our best garden party looks - big hats and fascinators welcome!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Come hungry!</p>
                <p>We're planning a great spread of all our garden party favourites and there will be something for everyone! We will also be serving coffee, tea, soft drinks and water. Let us know in the survey if you have any dietary restrictions we should keep in mind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-frame">
                <p class="question">Ready for a party?</p>
                <p>Us too! We can't serve alcohol in the park, so we're hosting an afterparty (details to be announced, it will be accessible and suitable for all ages). Let us know in the survey if you're interested in attending and we'll follow up with more info.</p>
